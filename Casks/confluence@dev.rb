  caveats <<~EOS
    Dev builds are ad-hoc signed prereleases, not notarised, so Gatekeeper
    blocks them on first launch. Homebrew no longer skips quarantine, so clear
    it once after installing:

      xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Confluence.app"

    Or approve it in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway.
